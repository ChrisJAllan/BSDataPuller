# DataPuller
 A plugin for BeatSaber that is like HttpStatus, but I made my own one with a few extra tweaks such as BSR code and player health.
This mod is easy to use, all you have to do is install it to your BeatSaber plugins directory and then either use my overlay or make your own.

## Options:
In the UserData folder you will find a text file called DataPuller.txt, in that file you can set the LAN IP to to the computer that you are playing on so that other devices in your network can connect to the mod.
