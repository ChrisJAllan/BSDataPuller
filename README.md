# DataPuller
A plugin for BeatSaber that is like [HttpStatus](https://github.com/opl-/beatsaber-http-status), but I made my own one with a few extra tweaks such as BSR code and player health.  

## Installation:
To install this mod all you have to do is download and place the plugin in your BeatSaber plugins directory.
### Requred Mods:
In order for this mod to function properly you must have installed the following mods:
- [BS Utils](https://github.com/Kylemc1413/Beat-Saber-Utils)

## Configuration:
In the UserData folder you will find a text file called DataPuller.txt, in that file you can set the LAN IP to to the computer that you are playing on so that other devices in your network can connect to the mod.
```ini
#Change the ip for use over lan, app default is 127.0.0.1
ip=
```

## Overlay:
There are few overlays that I know of at the moment but here are some:
| Overlay | Creator |
| --- | --- |
| [BSDP](https://github.com/kOFReadie/BeatSaber-Overlay) | kOF.Readie |
| [Freakylay](https://github.com/UnskilledFreak/Freakylay) - WIP | UnskilledFreak |

## Upcoming changes:
I plan to slightly improve the peformance of this again as well as adding new features like:
- Ranked status
- Map plays
- More block data
- etc
